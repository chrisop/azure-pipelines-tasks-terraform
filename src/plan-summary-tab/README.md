# Terraform Plan View

The Terraform Plan View allows a quick view of plans that were published during the pipeline run. 
The view is a simple React web page.
It is compiled with Webpack and is shown to the user inside of an Azure DevOps Build Pipeline if the Terraform extension is used.

The summary tab reads two attachments from the pipeline:

- Summary JSON: Which is a `.json` file with a summary of resources/outputs to create, update, destroy, or are unchanged
- Plan output: Which is a `.txt` file which is the stdout of running `terraform plan`

## Local Development and Testing

You can locally develop and test the summary tab.

From the root project directory:

1. Run `npm i` to install required packages
2. Run `npm run compile:test` to compile the tab with test data
3. If using VSCode you can use the Run/Debug Launch command `debug:test - summary tab - Chrome`
    - Alternatively you can open the `./dist/plan-summary-tab/plan-summary-tab.html` file in a browser of your choice
    - The debugger will use default remote debugging port 9222.
    To enable remote debugging in Chrome, launch Chrome with the `--remote-debugging-port=9222` command line option.
    
    For more information on this CLI option consult the `Debugger for Chrome` VSCode extension.

A Chrome browser with the plan summary tab will open.
The displayed content is the content which will be inside of the Azure DevOps Build Pipeline Tab.

For local testing purposes, a set mocked dummy terraform data is loaded.

## Test

To execute the unit tests, run the following npm command

```shell
npm run test
```

Alternatively, jest can be run directly using npx

```shell
npx jest
```

Tests can also be run via `tests - views/terraform-plan` VS Code Task.

Running tests will also output coverage results to `./.tests/coverage`.

### Debug Tests

Launching the VS Code `debug:tests - views/terraform-plan` launch configuration will run tests with VS Code debugging attached.
